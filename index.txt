ICA-AtoM documentation
======================

**ICA-AtoM 1.4 has not yet been released.**

Our hope is to eventually move all ICA-AtoM documentation to the `Sphinx
platform <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ - you will find new documents added here
as we are able to complete the migration. In the meantime, all ICA-AtoM
documentation can be found on the `ICA-AtoM wiki site <https://www.ica-
atom.org/doc/Main_Page>`__.

The **ICA-AtoM User Manual** is available
`here <https://www.ica-atom.org/doc/User_manual>`__

The current release of ICA-AtoM is 1.3.1 â€“ find release information `here
<https://www.ica-atom.org/doc/Release_1.3.1>`__, or download ICA-AtoM 1.3.1
