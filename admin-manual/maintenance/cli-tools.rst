==================
Command line tools
==================

There are a number of command line tools that can help you troubleshoot
various AtoM problems.

See below for :ref:`common-atom-queries`.

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`digital-object-load-task`
   * :ref:`csv-import`

.. _cli-get-version:

Find out what version of AtoM you're running
============================================

You can always find out what version of AtoM you have installed via the
:term:`user interface` by navigating to **Admin > Settings > Global** - the
application version is the first thing listed on the Settings page. See:
:ref:`application-version` for more information.

However, if you'd like to check the application version from the
command-line, you can run the following command from AtoM's root folder:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:get-version

.. _cli-add-superuser:

Add a SuperUser (Admin) account
===============================

You can create a new :term:`administrator` account from the command-line
using the following command:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:add-superuser --email="youremail@example.com" --password="MYSUPERPASSWORD" <username>

The username should not have any spaces in it.

If you'd like to quickly create a user for demonstration, diagnostic purposes,
you can use the following command:

   php symfony tools:add-superuser --demo

This will create a superuser with username "demo", email "demo@example.com",
and password "demo".

.. _cli-promote-user-admin:

Promote a user to an administrator
==================================

If you'd like to promote a user account in AtoM to have full
:term:`administrator` access privileges via the command-line, you can use the
following task. You will need to know the user name of the account.

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:promote-user-to-admin <username>

If the user doesn't exist you'll see the following error:

.. code:: bash

   Unknown user.

If the user is already an administrator:

.. code:: bash

   The given user is already an administrator.

If the operation succeeds:

.. code:: bash

   The user <username> is now an administrator.

.. SEEALSO::

   For more information on user permissions, user roles, and how to manage them,
   see:

   * :ref:`user-roles`
   * :ref:`manage-user-accounts`
   * :ref:`edit-user-permissions`

.. _cli-change-password:

Change a password
=================

If you need to change the password on a :term:`user account` in AtoM, you can
do so via the command-line.

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:reset-password [--activate] username [password]

The :term:`username` is a required value, while the password is optional - if
no password is entered, AtoM will generate an 8-character temporary password
to be used for the user account. AtoM will return the new password in the
command-line.

.. warning::

   We strongly recommend that these auto-generated passwords ONLY be used
   temporarily! They are not strong passwords - users should generate longer
   passwords that include special characters. For more information, see:

   * `Wikipedia - Password strength <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength>`__
   * `Wikipedia - Password cracking <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking>`__

If the user account is currently marked inactive in the system (see
:ref:`mark-user-inactive` for more information), you can also use the option
``--activate`` to mark that account as active again.

.. seealso::

   You can also manage user passwords through the :term:`user interface`. For
   more information, see:

   * :ref:`change-password`
   * :ref:`edit-user`

.. _cli-regenerate-derivatives:

Regenerating derivatives
========================

If you are upgrading to AtoM 2 from ICA-AtoM, the :term:`digital object`
derivatives (i.e. the :term:`reference display copy` and the
:term:`thumbnail` generated by AtoM when a :term:`master digital object` is
uploaded) are set to be a different default size (i.e. they are larger in
AtoM) - consequently, after an upgrade, derivatives from ICA-AtoM may appear
blurry or pixellated. Alternatively, if you have changed the
:ref:`digital-object-derivatives` settings, you might want to regenerate your
derivatives so that the new setting is used for multi-page content such as PDF
derivatives.

As well, sometimes the ``digitalobject:load`` task used for importing digital
objects to existing :term:`descriptions  <archival description>` (see:
:ref:`digital-object-load-task`) won't generate the :term:`thumbnail` and
reference images properly for digital objects that were loaded (e.g. due to a
crash or absence of convert installed, etc. - see under requirements,
:ref:`other-dependencies`). In this case, you can regenerate
these thumbsnail/reference images using the following command:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony digitalobject:regen-derivatives

By typing ``php symfony help digitalobject:regen-derivatives`` into the
command-line, you can see the options available for this task:

.. image:: images/cli-regen-derivs.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the options available in the regen-derivatives command

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the import.

The ``--index`` option is used to enable the rebuilding of the search index as
part of the regeneration task. When running this task via the command-line
interface, indexing is **disabled** by default to allow the task to progress
more quickly - generally, we recommend manually clearing the cache and
rebuilding the search index following the use of this task - to do so,
from AtoM's root directory, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony cc && php symfony search:populate

However, if you would like to re-index as the derivative regeneration progresses,
the ``--index`` option can be used to enable this.

The ``--slug`` option can be used to target specific derivatives associated with
a description, using the description's :term:`slug` as criteria. Any
:term:`digital object` attached or linked to the description whose slug is
provided as criteria will have its derivatives regenerated. Example use:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony digitalobject:regen-derivatives --slug="the-jane-doe-fonds"

The ``--force`` or ``-f`` option can be used to skip the warning normally
delivered by the task when the command is entered. Because the task will delete
ALL previous derivatives - including those manually altered by editing the
:term:`thumbnail` or :term:`reference display copy` of a digital object via the
user interface (see: :ref:`edit-digital-object` for more information) - the task
will normally ask for confirmation when invoked:

.. image:: images/cli-regen-derivs-warning.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of the CLI warning when invoking the regen-derivatives command

However, experienced developers and system administrators can skip having to
manually confirm the procedure by using the ``--force`` (or ``-f`` for short)
option as part of the command.

The ``--only-externals`` (or ``-o`` for short) option can be used if you would
only like to attempt to regenerate the local derivatives for linked digital
objects - that is, those that have been linked via an external URI, rather than
by uploading a :term:`master digital object`. For more information on linking
digital objects, see: :ref:`link-digital-object`.

The ``--skip-to`` option is useful when the task is interrupted, such as when
an error is encountered mid-process that ends the task. As the task
progresses during normal execution, it will output information about the
current digital object filename it is working on. If the task interrupts
(for example, trying to fetch a large external digital object, the task might
time out), a system administrator can use this option to resume the task
where it interrupts. Example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ php symfony digitalobject:regen-derivatives

   Regenerating derivatives for file1.jpg...
   Regenerating derivatives for file2.jpg...
   Regenerating derivatives for file3.jpg...

   <timeout error occurs>

   $ php symfony digitalobject:regen-derivatives --skip-to='file3.jpg'

   Regenerating derivatives for file3.jpg...
   <task continues where it left off>

The ``--json`` or ``-j`` option is for advanced users who would like to target
only a specific subset of digital objects for regeneration. With this option, a
user can supply the path to a JSON file that lists the internal
digital_object ID's associated with the digital objects targeted and stored in
AtoM's database. These digital_object ID's will first need to be determined
by crafting an SQL query designed to meet your specific criteria. Help crafting
these queries is not covered here (though you can see below,
:ref:`common-atom-queries`, for a BASIC introduction to SQL queries in AtoM) - in
general, we only recommend this task be used by experienced administators.

Once you have determined the IDs of the digital objects you would like to target
with the task, you can place them in square brackets in a JSON file, separated by
commas, like so:

.. code:: bash

   [372, 366, 423, 117]

*(etc)*

The criteria for the ``--json`` option then becomes the path to your JSON file:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony digitalobject:regen-derivatives --json="path/to/my.json"

.. WARNING::

   When running the ``regen-derivatives`` task, **all** of your current derivatives
   for the targeted digital objects will be deleted - meaning ALL of them if you
   provide no criteria such as a slug or a JSON file. They will be replaced
   with new derivatives after the task has finished running. If you have
   manually changed the :term:`thumbnail` or :term:`reference display copy`
   of a digital object via the user interface (see:
   :ref:`edit-digital-object`), these two will be replaced with digital
   object derivatives created from the :term:`master digital object`.

.. _cli-re-index-pdf:

Re-indexing PDF text
====================

.. code:: bash

   php symfony digitalobject:extract-text

In rare situations you may want to to re-index all PDFs to make their text
searchable in AtoM without having to re-import them completely. This task
will go through each existing PDF imported into AtoM and re-index their
contents for searches.

For linked :term:`digital objects <digital object>` (e.g. PDFs that are linked
from a publicly accessible URI, instead of uploaded locally - see for example:
:ref:`link-digital-object`), this task will re-fetch a version of the external
PDF and store it in a temporary file, re-index the contents, and then purge the
local :term:`master <master digital object>` after the indexing is complete.

.. TIP::

      .. image:: images/app-yml-settings.*
         :align: right
         :width: 20%
         :alt: An image of the app.yml file in AtoM

   Large PDFs may cause 500 errors if you do not first adjust the download
   timeout limit. You can do this by changing the value in the ``app.yml`` file
   located in ``/config/app.yml``. The default timeout value in AtoM is 10s. You
   should also clear the cache after making changes to the ``app.yml`` file:

   .. code:: bash

      php symfony cc


.. _cli-rebuild-nested-set:

Rebuild the nested set
======================

AtoM generally uses a relational database to store its data (we recommend
MySQL). However, relational databases, which are comprised of flat tables,
are not particularly suited to handling hierarchical data. As developer
`Mike Hillyer <http://mikehillyer.com/articles/managing-hierarchical-data-in-mysql/>`__
notes, "Hierarchical data has a parent-child relationship that is not naturally
represented in a relational database table." One method of addressing this is
to employ a "Nested set model" (`Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model>`__).
AtoM makes use of a nested set to manage hierarchical relationships, such as
between parent and child :term:`terms <term>` and
:term:`descriptions <archival description>`.

Sometimes, during operations that involve updates to large hierarchies, the
nested set can become corrupted - especially if the server times out during an
operation that reaches the execution limit settings. The following task will
rebuild all nested sets in AtoM:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony propel:build-nested-set

.. _cli-generate-slugs:

Generate slugs
==============

In some cases, AtoM may time out in the middle of an operation that involves
the creation of new records - for example, if a user attempts to import a
very large CSV file through the :term:`user interface` (rather than the
command-line - see: :ref:`csv-import`). In such cases, it is possible that
AtoM has died after creating an :term:`information object`, but before having
a chance to create a :term:`slug` for the record. This can cause unexpected
errors in the application - most notably, 500 errors when trying to access the
records missing slugs through the application interface.

If you want to generate slugs for records in AtoM without them, you can use
the following command:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony propel:generate-slugs

This task will work for the following entities:

* information objects (e.g. :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`)
* actors (e.g. :term:`authority records <authority record>`)
* terms
* physical objects (e.g. storage locations, etc)
* events (e.g. creation events, etc - usually the relationship between actors
  and information objects)
* accessions

If an error has left other areas in AtoM without slugs (for example, a user
account's view page, a donor record, etc), this task will **not** resolve the
issue - you will likely have to manually insert a slug into the database for
that entity.

For information objects, the generate slugs task will respect the global
settings for the source from which description permalinks are created. These
settings can be controlled by an :term:`administrator` via the user interface
- for more information, see: :ref:`description-permalinks`.

Note that by default, existing slugs will **not** be replaced. If you want to
generate new slugs for existing objects, you will need to first delete the
existing slugs from the database. This can be useful for records in which a
random slug has been automatically assigned, because the default user data
used to generate the slug has not been provided (see
:ref:`below <slugs-in-atom>` for more information on how slugs are generated in
AtoM).

However, if you would like to replace all existing slugs with newly generated
slugs, you can use the ``--delete`` option, like so:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony propel:generate-slugs --delete

.. IMPORTANT::

   This will replace all custom slugs you may have created with the
   Rename module! For more information on the Rename module, see:
   :ref:`rename-title-slug`

Slugs can also be manually deleted via SQL queries. For further information on
deleting slugs from AtoM's database via SQL, see below in the section on
:ref:`common-atom-queries` - particularly, :ref:`sql-delete-slugs`.

.. SEEALSO::

   * :ref:`sql-truncate-slugs`

.. _slugs-in-atom:

Notes on slugs in AtoM
----------------------

A :term:`slug` is a word or sequence of words which make up the last part of a
URL in AtoM. It is the part of the URL that uniquely identifies the resource
and often is indicative of the name or title of the page (e.g.: in
*www.yourwebpage.com/about*, the slug is *about*). The slug is meant to
provide a unique, human-readable, permanent link to a resource.

In AtoM, all pages based on user data (such as :term:`archival descriptions
<archival description>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`,
:term:`authority records <authority record>`, :term:`terms <term>`, etc.) are
automatically assigned a slug based on the information entered into the
resource:

==================== =============================
Entity type          Slug derived from
==================== =============================
Archival description Title or Reference code
Authority record     Authorized form of name
Accession            Identifier (accession number)
Other entities       Name
==================== =============================

Generated slugs will only allow digits, letters, and dashes. English articles
(such as "the," "a," "an," etc) are removed, and any other sequences of
unaccepted characters (e.g. accented or special characters, etc.) are replaced
with dashes. This conforms to general practice around slug creation - for example,
it is "common practice to make the slug all lowercase, accented characters are
usually replaced by letters from the English alphabet, punctuation marks are
generally removed, and long page titles should also be truncated to keep the
final URL to a reasonable length"
(`Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL#Slug>`__). In AtoM, slugs
are truncated to a maximum of 250 characters.

If a slug is already in use, AtoM will append a dash and an incremental number
(a numeric suffix) to the new slug - for example, if the slug "*correspondence*"
is already in use, the next record with a title of "Correspondence" will
receive the slug "*correspondence-2*".

If a record is created without data in the :term:`field` from which the slug
is normally derived (e.g. an :term:`archival description` created without a
title), AtoM will assign it a randomly generated alpha-numeric slug. Once
assigned, slugs cannot be changed through the :term:`user interface` - either
the record must be deleted and a new record created, or you must manipulate
the database directly.

Finally, :term:`static pages <static page>`, or permanent links, include a
slug :term:`field` option, but only slugs for new static pages can be edited
by users; the slugs for the default :term:`Home page` and :term:`About page`
in AtoM **cannot** be edited. New static page slugs can either be customized
by users or automatically generated by AtoM if the field is left blank; AtoM
will automatically generate a slug that is based on the "Title" you have
indicated for the new static page. For more information on static pages in
AtoM, see: :ref:`manage-static-pages`.

.. NOTE::

   Slugs such as "search" and "browse" are reserved for use in AtoM by the
   Search and Browse modules - if you create a static page, or even a
   description, with the slug "search", it may interfere with your search
   results, redirecting to this new page instead of display your results! A
   simple workaround would be to iterate the slug (e.g. "search-1") or alter
   it in some meaningful way (e.g. for a static page with tips on searching,
   changing the slug to "search-help").

.. TIP::

   For developers interested in seeing the code where slugs are handled in
   AtoM, see ``/lib/model/QubitSlug.php``

.. _cli-normalize-taxonomy:

Taxonomy normalization
======================

A command-line tool will run through :term:`taxonomy` terms, consolidating
duplicate terms. If you've got two terms named "Vancouver" in the "Places"
taxonomy, for example, it will update term references to point to one of the
terms and will delete the others.

.. code:: bash

   php symfony taxonomy:normalize [--culture=<culture>] <taxonomy name>

**Task options**

.. image:: images/cli-taxonomy-normalize.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of the CLI options when invoking the taxonomy:normalize command

By entering ``php symfony help taxonomy:normalize`` into the command-line, you
see the options and descriptions available on this tool, as pictured above.

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the import.

The ``--culture`` option on this command-line tool is optional - the default
value, if none is entered is *en* (English). The value you
enter for <culture> should be the default culture of the terms you wish to
normalize - in most cases this will be the default culture you set up when
installing AtoM (though depending on your imports and multi-lingual use of the
application, this may not always be true) The value, if needed, should be
entered using two-letter ISO  639-1 language code values - for example,
"en" for English; "fr" for French,  "it" for Italian, etc.
See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>`__ for a
full list of ISO 639-1 language codes.

The taxonomy name value should be entered as it is seen in the :term:`user
interface` in **Manage > Taxonomies**. This value is case sensitive. If the
taxonomy name has spaces (i.e. if it is more than one word), you will want to
use quotation marks.

Below is an example of running this command on French terms in the Physical
object type taxonomy:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony taxonomy:normalize --culture="fr" "Physical object type"

You might also run this command on English terms in the Places taxonomy like
so:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony taxonomy:normalize Places

.. _cli-update-publication-status:

Update the publication status of descriptions
=============================================

In AtoM, an :term:`archival description` can have :term:`publication status`
of either "Draft" or "Published". The publication status of a record, which
can be set to either :term:`draft <draft record>` or
:term:`published <published record>`, determines whether or not the associated
description is visible to unauthenticated (i.e., not logged in) users, such as
:term:`researchers <researcher>`. It can be changed via the
:term:`user interface` in the :term:`administration area` of a description's
:term:`edit page` by a user with edit permissions.
See :ref:`publish-archival-description` for instructions on changing this via
the user interface.

If you would like to change the publication status of a record via the
command-line, you can use the following command-line tool, run from the root
directory of AtoM. You will need to know the :term:`slug` of the description
whose publication status you wish to update. 

You can also update the publication status of all descriptions associated with 
an :term:`archival institution` by using the ``--repo`` option and providing a 
:term:`repository` slug instead - details are included below. Here is the basic 
syntax of the command with all options shown: 

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:update-publication-status [--application[="..."]] [--env="..."] [--connection="..."] [-f|--force] [-i|--ignore-descendants] [-y|--no-confirm] [-r|--repo] publicationStatus slug

Notes on use
------------

AtoM requires two parameters to be able to execute the task: the publication
status you wish to use, and the :term:`slug` of a resource on which to perform
the task. For the publication status, you can use any term you have added to the
Publication status :term:`taxonomy` in AtoM - the default terms are Draft, and
Published. You **cannot** create a new publication status :term:`term` by using
this task - the term must already exist in AtoM, or the task will fail.

**Example use (no options)** - update a description with a slug of
``example-description`` to published:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:update-publication-status published example-description

**Task options:**

.. image:: images/cli-pub-status.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: The CLI options when invoking the publication status command

By entering ``php symfony help tools:update-publication-status`` into the
command-line, you see the options available on this tool, as pictured above.

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the task.

In general and as in the user interface, if a :term:`parent <parent record>`
description is updated, it will also update the publication status of its
children. In some rare cases however, there may be legacy records in the
system with a publication status of NULL. The command-line option ``--force``,
or ``-f`` for short, will force the update of the target information object
and all of its :term:`children <child record>`, including legacy records that 
might have a publication status of NULL. We recommend using this option any 
time you want a publication status update to affect children as well.

The ``--ignore-descendents``, or ``-i``, option can be used to leave the
publication status of all :term:`children <child record>` unchanged. This is
useful if you have a mixture of publication statuses at lower levels - some
draft, and some published.

Normally when the command is run, AtoM will ask for a y/N confirmation before
proceeding. The ``--no-confirm`` or ``-y`` option was introduced so that
developers who are interested in using this task in a larger scripted action
can override the confirmation step.

If the ``--repo`` or ``-r`` option is used, AtoM will update the publication
status for **ALL** descriptions belonging to the associated
:term:`repository` (i.e. :term:`archival institution`). To use this option,
you must supply the :term:`slug` of the repository. 

**Example use** - updating all the descriptions associated with "My archival
institution" (slug = ``my-archival-institution``) to published.

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:update-publication-status --repo published my-archival-institution

As the task proceeds, it will print a ``.`` period in the command-line for each
record that is updated, providing a visual indication of progress. 


.. image:: images/cli-update-pub-repo.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: The CLI output when updating all descriptions associated with a repository

.. WARNING::

   This task is NOT designed for scalability. If you are planning on updating
   the publication status of thousands of records, we recommend using SQL to
   do so instead. We have included instructions on how to do so below - see:

   * :ref:`sql-update-publication-status`
   * :ref:`sql-update-publication-status-repo`


:ref:`Back to top <maintenance-cli-tools>`

.. _cli-delete-description:

Delete a description
====================

You can delete a description from the command-line if you know the
description's :term:`slug`. A slug is a word or sequence of words which make
up a part of a URL that  identifies a page in AtoM. It is the part of the URL
located at the end of the URL path and often is indicative of the name or
title of the page (e.g.: in  *www.youratom.com/this-description*, the slug
is *this-description*). When a new information object is created in AtoM,
the slug for that page is generated based on the title, with spaces,
stopwords, and special characters stripped out.

If you know the slug of a description you'd like to delete, use the following
command to delete it from the command-line:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:delete-description <slug>

AtoM will ask you for confirmation before you proceed giving you a count of
descriptions affected (e.g. the target description and its descendants):

.. image:: images/cli-delete-description.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: The CLI warning when deleting a description

.. TIP::

   If you would like to proceed without having to confirm your actions, you
   can use the ``--no-confirmation`` option - or its shorthand, ``-B``, like
   so:

   .. code:: bash

      php symfony tools:delete-description -B <slug>

:ref:`Back to top <maintenance-cli-tools>`

.. _cli-delete-drafts:

Delete all draft descriptions
=============================

If you want to remove all :term:`draft <draft record>` information object (e.g.
:term:`archival description`) records from AtoM, you can use the following
command-line tool to delete all records with a :term:`publication status` of
"Draft":

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:delete-drafts

The task will ask you to confirm the operation:

.. code:: bash

   >> delete-drafts Deleting all information objects marked as draft...
   Are you SURE you want to do this (y/n)?

Enter "y" if you are certain you would like to delete all draft records.

.. _cli-scrub-html:

Remove HTML content from archival description fields
====================================================

As of the 2.2 release, HTML added to atom's descriptive templates will be
automatically escaped for security purposes. This means that if you were
previously using HTML to style content added to an edit template, it may no
longer display correctly:

.. image:: images/escaped-content.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of how escaped HTML content will appear when saved in AtoM

To assist legacy users who have added HTML to
:term:`archival descriptions <archival description>`, a command-line task to
strip the HTML from descriptions has been added. At present, it will only
remove HTML from archival descriptions - other :term:`entity` types (such as
archival institution records, accessions, authority records, etc) will not be
affected.

.. IMPORTANT::

   There are also some fields in the information object (e.g.
   :term:`archival description`) that **do not** currently support this task -
   meaning HTML will **not** be removed from these fields by running this CLI
   task:

   * :ref:`RAD <rad-template>` title note (e.g. Source of title proper,
     Attributions and conjectures, etc)
   * General notes fields in any template
   * :ref:`RAD <rad-template>` Other notes and :ref:`DACS <dacs-template>`
     Specialized notes (e.g. Variant title information, citation, or
     record-keeping activity notes in DACS; Accompanying material, cast,
     editions, or physical description notes in RAD)

**To run the HTML scrub task:**

From the root directory of your AtoM installation, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony i18n:remove-html-tags

The command-line interface will output information on how many fields within
each :term:`information object` were scrubbed, as well as a summary when the
task terminates:

.. image:: images/scrub-html-changes.*
   :align: center

   :alt: An image of the command-line output after executing the remove html
         tags task

The task will have the following effects on HTML elements:

* Links, including email ``mailto:`` links, will be replaced with AtoM's
  custom formatting for links - for more information, see:
  :ref:`add-custom-links`. This means that after being run, links will now
  appear in AtoM's view pages as they were intended to when the HTML was
  added.
* Styling elements, such as ``<em>``, ``<b>``, ``<strong>``, ``<i>``, etc.
  will be removed with no substitutions (the text they wrap will be
  preserved).
* List elements (``<li>``) will be replaced with an asterix and a space -
  AtoM's edit templates already include a helper that will transform asterixes
  used this way into bullets. So, ``<ul><li>This item</li></ul>`` will become
  ``* This item``
* Definition list elements such as ``<dd>``, ``<dt>``, etc (which were briefly
  used in earlier versions of AtoM to structure physical description EAD
  import data) will be removed (the text they wrap will be preserved).
* Paragraph tags (``<p>``) will be removed, and substituted with 2 line breaks
  to preserve spacing (i.e. ``/n/n``)

.. _cli-purge-data:

Purging all data
================

If you're working with an AtoM installation and want to, for whatever reason,
purge all data you can do this with a command-line tool:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:purge

.. warning::

   This will delete ALL DATA in your AtoM instance! Be sure this is what you
   want to do before you proceed. You may want to back up your database first
   - see :ref:`below <cli-backup-db>`

The tool will prompt you for the title and description of your site as well as
for details needed to create a new admin user. If a ``.gitconfig`` file is present
in your home directory purge will use your name and email, from that file, to
provide default values.

If you are a developer or system administrator using this task for testing purposes,
there is also a ``--demo`` option available:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony tools:purge --demo

.. IMPORTANT::

   Using the ``--demo`` option with the purge task will have the following
   consequences:

   * The task will NOT ask for confirmation before purging all data (the warning is skipped)
   * It will repopulate the database with a default demo user

     * Username: demo
     * Email: demo@example.com
     * Pass: demo

   * It will add a site title to the installation - "Demo site".
   * It will **NOT** clear the application cache. We recommend clearing the
     cache and restarting all services after running this task - e.g.

   .. code-block:: bash

      php symfony cc
      sudo service php5-fpm restart
      sudo /etc/init.d/memcached restart

   See :ref:`manage-user-accounts` for information on how to edit or delete the
   demo user account via the :term:`user interface`. See: :ref:`site-information`
   for instructions on how to edit the site title via the user interface. See
   :ref:`maintenance-clear-cache` for more information on clearing the cache.

.. _cli-backup-db:

Backing up the database
=======================

.. seealso::

   :ref:`maintenance-data-backup`

To back up a MySQL database, use the following command:

.. code:: bash

   mysqldump -u myusername -p mydbname > ./mybackupfile.sql

Be sure to use your username / password / database name. To restore
the database as it was during the dump command, you can suck it back in with
this command:

.. code:: bash

   mysql -u myusername -p mydbname < ./mybackupfile.sql

The database is now restored to the point when you dumped it.

.. _cli-bulk-import-xml:

Bulk import of XML files
========================

While XML files can be imported individually via the :term:`user interface`
(see: :ref:`import-descriptions-terms`), it may be desireable to import multiple
XML files, or large files (typically larger than 1 MB) through the command line.

.. code:: bash

   php symfony import:bulk /path/to/my/xmlFolder

Using the import:bulk command
-----------------------------

.. image:: images/bulk-import-cli-options.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the options available in the import:bulk command

By typing ``php symfony help import:bulk`` into the command-line without
specifying the path to a directory of XML files, you can see the options
available on the ``import:bulk`` command, as pictured above.

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the import.

The ``--index`` option is used to enable the rebuilding of the search index as
part of the import task. When using the :ref:`user interface <import-xml>` to
import XML files, the import is indexed automatically - but when running
an import via the command-line interface, indexing is **disabled** by default.
This is because indexing during import can be incredibly slow, and the
command-line is generally used for larger imports. Generally, we recommend a
user simply clear the cache and rebuild the search index following an import -
from AtoM's root directory, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony cc & php symfony search:populate

However, if you would like to index the import as it progresses, the
``--index`` option can be used to enable this.

The ``--taxonomy`` option is used to assist in the import of SKOS xml files,
such as :term:`places <place>` and :term:`subjects <subject>`, ensuring that
the :term:`terms <term>` are imported to the correct :term:`taxonomy`. As
input, the ``--taxonomy`` option takes a taxonomy ID - these are permanent
identifiers used internally in AtoM to manage the various taxonomies, which
can be found in AtoM in ``/lib/model/QubitTaxonomy.php`` (see on GitHub
:at-gh:`here <lib/model/QubitTaxonomy.php#L20>`).

**Example use:** Importing terms to the Places taxonomy

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony import:bulk --taxonomy="42" /path/to/mySKOSfiles

**Example use:** Importing terms to the Subjects taxonomy

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony import:bulk --taxonomy="35" /path/to/mySKOSfiles

Below is a list of some of the more commonly used taxonomies in AtoM, and
their IDs. This list is NOT comprehensive - to see the full list, navigate to
``/lib/model/QubitTaxonomy.php``, or visit the Github link above.

=================================== ===
Taxonomy name                       ID
=================================== ===
 Places                             42
 Subjects                           35
 Level of description               34
 Actor entity type (ISAAR)          32
 Thematic area (repository)         72
 Geographic subregion (repository)  73
=================================== ===

The ``--completed-dir`` option is used to automatically move files (e.g. XML
files during an import) into a completed directory after they have imported. This
can be useful during troubleshooting, to determine which files have imported and
which have failed. The option takes a file path to the chosen directory as its
parameter. You must manually create the directory first - the task will not
automatically generate one at the specified location. Example use:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony import:bulk --completed-dir="/path/to/my/completed-directory" /path/to/my/importFolder

The ``--output`` option will generate a simple CSV file containing details of
the import process, including the time elapsed and memory used during each
import. To use the option, you mush specify both a path and a filename for the
CSV file to output. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony import:bulk --output="/path/to/output-results.csv" /path/to/my/importFolder

The CSV contains 3 columns. The first (titled "File" in the first row) will
list the path and filename of each imported file. The second column (titled
"Time elapsed (secs)" in the first row) indicates the time elapsed during the
import of that XML file, in seconds, while the third column (titled "Memory
used") indicates the memory used during the XML import of that file, in bytes.
Also included, at the bottom of the CSV, are two summary rows: Total time
elapsed (in seconds), and Peak memory usage (in megabytes).

.. image:: images/bulk-import-output-example.*
   :align: center
   :width: 60%
   :alt: an example of the CSV output after an import using the output option

The ``--verbose`` option will return a more verbose output as each import is
completed. Normally, after the import completes, a summary of the number of
files imported, the time elapsed, and the memory used:

.. code-block:: bash

   Successfully imported [x] XML/CSV files in [y] s. [z] bytes used."

... where [x] is the number of files imported, [y] is a count of the time
elapsed in seconds, and [z] is the memory used in bytes.

.. image:: images/import-bulk-summary-msg.*
   :align: center
   :width: 80%
   :alt: an example of the summary output after an import

If the ``--verbose`` command-line option is used (or just ``-v`` for short),
the task will output summary information for each XML file imported, rather
than a total summary. The summary information per file includes file name,
time elapsed during import ( in seconds), and its position in the total count
of documents to import. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   [filename] imported.  [x]s  [y]/[z] total

... where [x] is the time elapsed in seconds, [y] is the current file's
number and [z] is the total number of files to be imported.

.. _cli-bulk-export:

Bulk export of XML files
========================

While XML files can be exported individually via the :term:`user interface`
(see: :ref:`export-descriptions-terms`), it may be desireable to export multiple
XML files, or large files (typically larger than 1 MB) through the command line.
This can avoid browser-timeout issues when trying to export large files, and
it can be useful for extracting several descriptions at the same time. XML
files will be exported to a directory; you must first create the target
directory, and then you will specify the path to it when invoking the export
command:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony export:bulk /path/to/my/xmlExportFolder

.. NOTE::

   There is also a separate bulk export command for EAC-CPF XML files (e.g. for
   exporting :term:`authority records <authority record>` via the command-line.
   It uses the same CLI options as the EAD XML export task. See
   :ref:`below <cli-bulk-export-eac>` below for syntax; see the EAD
   :ref:`usage <cli-bulk-export-usage>` guidelines for how to use the available
   options.

.. IMPORTANT::

   The :ref:`inherit-reference-code` setting also determines how the
   ``<unitid>`` element in the EAD XML is populated. If the inheritance is
   turned on, then AtoM will populate all descendant records in the EAD XML
   with the full inherited reference code. If inheritance is turned off, AtoM
   will only add the identifier for that record in the ``<unitid>`` on export.
   This allows users exporting to a different source system that does not have
   a reference code inheritance setting to maintain a full reference code at
   all levels in the target system. **However, if you are exporting from one
   AtoM instance to another** (for example, from a local institution to a
   portal site), you might want to consider how this will impact your record
   display in the target system - if you have reference code inheritance
   turned on when you export, and the target AtoM instance *also* has the
   setting turned on, you may end up with duplication in the display!

.. _cli-bulk-export-usage:

Using the export:bulk command
-----------------------------

.. image:: images/export-bulk-cli-options.*
   :align: center
   :width: 85%
   :alt: An image of the options available in the export:bulk command

By typing ``php symfony help export:bulk`` into the command-line without
specifying the path to the target directory of exported XML files, you can see
the options available on the ``export:bulk`` command, as pictured above.

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the import.

The ``--items-until-update`` option can be used for a simple visual
representation of progress in the command-line. Enter a whole integer, to
represent the number of XML files that should be exported before the
command-line prints a period (e.g. ``.`` ) in the console, as a sort of
crude progress bar. For example, entering ``--items-until-update=5`` would
mean that the import progresses, another period will be printed every 5 XML
exports. This is a simple way to allow the command-line to provide a visual
output of progress.

Example use reporting progress every 5 rows:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony export:bulk --items-until-update=5 /path/to/my/exportFolder

This can be useful for large bulk exports, to ensure the export is still
progressing, and to try to roughly determine how far the task has progressed
and how long it will take to complete.

The ``--format`` option will determine whether the target export uses EAD XML,
or MODS XML. When not set, the default is to export using EAD. Example use:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony export:bulk --format="mods" /path/to/my/exportFolder

The ``--criteria`` option can be added if you would like to use raw SQL to
target specific descriptions.

**Example 1: exporting all draft descriptions**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony export:bulk --criteria="i.id IN (SELECT object_id FROM status WHERE status_id = 159 AND type_id = 158)" /path/to/my/exportFolder

If you wanted to export all published descriptions instead, you could simply
change the value of the ``status_id`` in the query from 159 (draft) to 160
(published).

**Example 2: exporting all descriptions from a specific repository**

To export all descriptions associated with a particular
:term:`archival institution`, you simply need to know the :term:`slug` of the
institution's record in AtoM. In this example, the slug is
"example-repo-slug":

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony export:bulk --criteria="i.repository_id = (SELECT object_id FROM slug WHERE slug='example-repo-slug')" /path/to/my/exportFolder

**Example 3: exporting specific descriptions by title**

To export 3 fonds titled: "779 King Street, Fredericton deeds," "1991 Canada
Winter Games fonds," and "A history of Kincardine," You can issue the
following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo php symfony export:bulk --criteria="i18n.title in ('779 King Street, Fredericton deeds', '1991 Canada Winter Games fonds', 'A history of Kincardine')" path/to/my/exportFolder

You could add additional archival descriptions of any level of description into
the query by adding a comma then another title in quotes within the ()s.

The ``--current-level-only`` option can be used to prevent AtoM from exporting
any :term:`children <child record>` associated with the target descriptions.
If you are exporting :term:`fonds`, then only the fonds-level description
would be exported, and no lower-level records such as series, sub-series,
files, etc. This might be useful for bulk exports when the intent is to submit
the exported descriptions to a union catalogue or regional portal that only
accepts collection/fonds-level descriptions. If a lower-level description
(e.g. a series, file, or item) is the target of the export, it's
:term:`parents <parent record>` will not be exported either.

The ``--single-slug`` option can be used to to target a single :term:`archival unit`
(e.g. fonds, collection, etc) for export, if you know the :term:`slug` of the
target description.

**Example use**

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony export:bulk --single-slug="test-export" /path/to/my/directory/test-export.xml

.. IMPORTANT::

   For the export task to succeed when using the ``--single-slug`` option, you
   **must** specify not just a target output directory, but a target output file
   name. Exporting to ``path/to/my/directory/`` will result in nothing being
   exported - you will be given a warning that the path should be a file -
   while exporting to ``path/to/my/directory/some-filename.xml`` will succeed.
   Note that the task **cannot** create new directories - but you can give the
   target file any name you wish (ending in ``.xml``); it doesn't need to be
   based on the target :term:`slug`.

   .. image:: images/single-slug-warning.*
      :align: center
      :width: 90%
      :alt: An example of using the single-slug option

The  ``--public`` option is useful for excluding draft records from an export.
Normally, all records in a hierarchical tree will be exported regardless of
:term:`publication status`. Note that if a published record is the child of a
draft record, it will **not** be included when this option is used - when the
parent is skipped (as a draft record), the children are also skipped, so as not
to break the established hierarchy.

.. _cli-bulk-export-eac:

Exporting EAC-CPF XML for authority records
-------------------------------------------

In addition to the bulk export CLI tool for archival descriptions described above,
AtoM also has a separate command-line task for the bulk export of
:term:`authority records <authority record>` in EAC-CPF XML format.

The EAC-CPF XML standard is prepared and maintained by the Technical Subcommittee
for Encoded Archival Context of the Society of American Archivists and the
Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin, and a version of the Tag Library is available at:

* http://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/fileadmin/user_upload/schema/cpfTagLibrary.html

When using the task, EAC-CPF XML files will be exported to a directory; you must
first create the target directory, and then you will specify the path to it when
invoking the export command:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony export:auth-recs /path/to/my/xmlExportFolder

The authority record bulk export task has the same options available as the
archival description export task described :ref:`above <cli-bulk-export-usage>`.
Some of these options will not be relevant to EAC-CPF exports (e.g. the
``--current-level-only`` option, as authority records are not hierarchical; and
the ``--public`` option, as currently authority records do not have a publication
status), but otherwise they can be used with this task in the same way as
described for the archival description export options
:ref:`above <cli-bulk-export-usage>`. Please refer there for more detailed usage
notes. Below is an example application, using the ``--criteria`` option:

**Example: using the** ``--criteria`` **option to select only authority records 
whose entity type is "family"**

First, you will need to know the entity type ID for family. Entity type is a 
:term:`term` maintained in the Actor entity types :term:`taxonomy` - when elements 
from a different table in the database are linked to actors, the term ID is used. 
Here are the term object IDs for the Actor entity types: 

============== =======          
Term           Term ID 
============== =======
Corporate body 131
Person         132
Family         133
============== =======

.. TIP::

   An easy way to figure this out in the user interface is to use the related 
   Entity type facet on the authority record browse page, and look at the 
   resulting URL. For example, if we go to the public AtoM demo site, navigate
   to the Authority record browse page, and use the facet to limit the results
   to those records with an Entity type of family, the resulting URL is: 

   * https://demo.accesstomemory.org/actor/browse?types=133&sort=alphabetic

   See the ``133`` in the URL? This represents the Entity type we have applied
   to filter the results! 

We can now use the entity type to limit our export to include only those authority 
records with an entity type of "Family," like so: 

.. code:: bash

   php symfony export:auth-recs --criteria='a.entity_type_id=133' path/to/my/export-folder

:ref:`Back to the top <maintenance-cli-tools>`

.. _cli-sitemap:

Generate an XML sitemap for search engine optimization
======================================================

This task will allow a system administrator with to generate an XML sitemap of
your AtoM instance, to enhance search engine optimization. It uses the sitemap
protocol, as described on sitemaps.org. From the site's home page:

    *Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters to inform search engines about
    pages on their sites that are available for crawling. In its simplest
    form, a Sitemap is an XML file that lists URLs for a site along with
    additional metadata about each URL (when it was last updated, how often
    it usually changes, and how important it is, relative to other URLs in
    the site) so that search engines can more intelligently crawl the site.*

    *Web crawlers usually discover pages from links within the site and from
    other sites. Sitemaps supplement this data to allow crawlers that support
    Sitemaps to pick up all URLs in the Sitemap and learn about those URLs
    using the associated metadata. Using the Sitemap protocol does not
    guarantee that web pages are included in search engines, but provides
    hints for web crawlers to do a better job of crawling your site.*

    source: http://www.sitemaps.org/

This XML sitemap can then be passed to search index providers such as Google,
for better indexing of your AtoM instance. Multiple sitemaps can be generated
by the task to account for Google's limits on size and/or number of nodes. If
the sitemap file has more than 50,000 nodes, it will automatically be broken
into multiple sitemaps.

More information:

* On the protocol: http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html
* Google support: https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/183668?hl=en&ref_topic=6080646&rd=1

The task will draw the default weighting for each :term:`level of description`
used in :term:`archival descriptions <archival description>` from a
configuration file found in ``config/sitemap.yml``. Here are the default
weightings (or priorities) for each level included:

====================  ==============
Level of description  Default weight
====================  ==============
Collection             0.9
Fonds                  0.9
Subfonds               0.8
Series                 0.7
Subseries              0.6
File                   0.5
Item                   0.4
====================  ==============

If a user adds a custom level of description to the Level of description
:term:`taxonomy` (see: :ref:`terms`), or if you wish to change the default
priorities, you can edit the ``sitemap.yml`` file found in the config directory.
see: :ref:`config-sitemap-yml` for more information.

.. IMPORTANT::

   There is currently no way to add custom weights for other
   :term:`entities <entity>` in AtoM such as :term:`authority records
   <authority record>`, :term:`archival institutions <archival institution>`,
   :term:`functions <function>`, or :term:`static pages <static page>`, etc.

   The **default weighting** for new :term:`archival description` levels of
   description added, without a custom entry into the ``config/sitemap.yml``
   file is **0.9**.

   By default, authority records receive a weight of **0.5** and static pages
   a weight of **1.0**.

When the command is run, at least 2 files are generated - by default they are
added to the root AtoM directory (though a specific location can be specified
using the task's options - see below). A ``sitemap.xml`` file acts as a
pointer file when multiple sitemaps are produced (e.g. if there are more than
50,000 nodes, the task will automatically break this up into 2 or more XML
files, as per Google's recommendations). If only 1 sitemap file is produced,
this pointer will still be generated, but will not be needed and can be
discarded if desired. The other file (or files) is the actual sitemap for your
AtoM instance - by default it is compressed using
`Gzip <https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/>`__, although again there is also an
option to disable this if desired.

**Using the sitemap generation command-line task:**

Example use:

.. code-block:: bash

   php symfony tools:sitemap

.. image:: images/cli-sitemap-help.*
   :align: center
   :width: 70%
   :alt: An image of the help page for the sitemap CLI tool

By typing ``php symfony help tools:sitemap`` into the command-line, you can
see the options available on the ``export:bulk`` command, as pictured above.

The ``--application``, ``--env``, and ``connection`` options **should not be
used** - AtoM requires the uses of the pre-set defaults for symfony to be
able to execute the task.

the ``--output-directory`` (or ``-O`` for short) option is used to specify a
specific location for the sitemap XML files on output - by default, they are
added to AtoM's root directory.

The ``--base-url`` option can be used to specify a base URL for the AtoM
instance, used in the sitmap XML files generated. Note that AtoM will use the
value entered in the **Admin > Settings > Site information** page for the Base
URL by default, so if you've added the correct value there, you shouldn't need
this option. See: :ref:`site-information` for more on Base URLs.

The ``--indent`` is a boolean value - by default, the XML generated will be
indented and formatted to assist human readability (e.g. ``--indent=1``).
However, if desired, linebreaks and indentation can be removed, but adding
``--indent=0`` to the command

Also by default, the XML sitemap generated will be compressed using
`Gzip <https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/>`__ - however, if desired, you can
prevent the compression by using the ``--no-compress`` option.

If an older sitemap already exists in the target directory when the task is
run, AtoM will ask you to confirm if you want the older versions to be
overwritten or not. If you don't want this interruption (e.g. if you are using
this task as part of an automated deployment, etc), you can skip the
confirmation step with ``--no-confirmation``, or ``-B`` for short.

Finally, if you would like the sitemap(s) to be submitted to Bing and Google
after generation, you can add the ``--ping`` option to the command.

.. _common-atom-queries:

============================
Common AtoM database queries
============================

Occasionally manually modifying the AtoM database is required, such as when
data gets corrupted from timeouts or other bugs. Here we will include a few
useful queries based on common actions users wish to perform on their
databases, which are not accommodated from the user interface. For all of
these, you will need to execute them from inside MySQL, using the username
and password you created during installation.

Assuming your username and pass are both set to "root", here is an example of
what you would type into the command-line:

.. code:: bash

   $ mysql -u root -p root

Once you've accessed the database, you can run SQL queries to manually modify
the AtoM database.

.. important::

   We strongly recommend that you back-up all of your data prior to
   manipulating the database! If possible, you should test the outcome on a
   cloned development instance of AtoM, rather than performing these actions
   on a production site without testing them in advance.


.. _sql-update-publication-status:

Update all draft archival descriptions to published
===================================================

Use this command to publish all draft descriptions in AtoM:

.. code:: bash

   UPDATE status SET status_id=160 WHERE type_id=158 AND object_id <> 1;


.. _sql-update-publication-status-repo:

Update all draft archival descriptions from a particular repository to published
================================================================================

First, retrieve the id of the repository from the slug. In this example, the
repository is at http://myatomsite.com/atom/index.php/my-test-repo

.. code:: bash

   SELECT object_id FROM slug WHERE slug='my-test-repo';

Assuming in this example the id returned is 123, you would then execute the
following query to perform the publication status updates:

.. code:: bash

   UPDATE status
     SET status_id=160
     WHERE type_id=158 AND status_id=159
     AND object_id IN (
       SELECT id FROM information_object
       WHERE repository_id=123
     );

Don't forget to rebuild the search index!

.. code:: bash

   php symfony search:populate

.. _sql-truncate-slugs:

Truncate slugs to maximum character length
==========================================

This command will truncate all :term:`slugs <slug>` to a specified maximum
character length. In the example below, the character length is 245.

.. code:: bash

   UPDATE slug SET slug = LEFT(slug, 245) WHERE LENGTH(slug) > 245;

.. _sql-delete-slugs:

Delete slugs from AtoM
======================

In some cases, you may wish to replace the existing :term:`slugs <slug>` in AtoM -
particularly if they have been randomly generated because the user-supplied
data from which the slug is normally derived (e.g. the "Title" field for an
:term:`archival description`) was not entered when the record was created.
For more information on how slugs are generated by AtoM, see above,
:ref:`slugs-in-atom`. If you have since supplied the relevant information
(e.g. added a title to your archival description), you may want to generate a
new slug for it that is more meaningful.

In such a case, you will need to delete the slug in AtoM's database first -
after which you can run the command-line task to generate slugs for those
without them (see above, :ref:`cli-generate-slugs`). AtoM slugs are
conveniently stored in a table named "slug" - if you know the slug you'd like
to delete, you can use the following command to delete it from AtoM's
database (replacing *your-slug-here* with the slug you'd like to delete):

.. code:: bash

   DELETE FROM slug WHERE slug='your-slug-here';

.. IMPORTANT::

   **Remember**, you will run into problems if you don't replace the slug!
   You can use the generate-slug task to do so; see
   :ref:`cli-generate-slugs`, above. Remember as well: if you are trying to
   replace a randomnly generated slug, but you haven't filled in the data
   field from which the slug is normally derived prior to deleting the old
   slug (see :ref:`above <slugs-in-atom>` for more on how slugs are generated
   in AtoM), you will end up with another randomly generated slug!

If you wanted to delete all slugs associated with descriptions (e.g.
:term:`information objects <information object>`) and :term:`terms <term>`,
you could use the following example SQL query to delete them:

.. IMPORTANT::

   Make sure you back up your data before proceeding! See:
   :ref:`cli-backup-db`.

.. code:: bash

   DELETE
   FROM slug
   WHERE (object_id IN
         (SELECT id
          FROM term)
       OR object_id IN
         (SELECT id
          FROM information_object))
   AND object_id <> 1;

You can then use the generate-slugs task to generate new slugs:

.. code:: bash

   php symfony propel:generate-slugs

See :ref:`above <cli-generate-slugs>` for further documentation on this
command-line tool.

If you wanted to delete **all** slugs currently stored in AtoM, you could do
so with the following query:

.. code:: bash

   DELETE FROM slug;

.. WARNING::

   This is an extreme action, and it will delete **ALL** slugs, including
   custom slugs for your static pages - and may break your application. The
   :ref:`generate-slugs task <cli-generate-slugs>` will not replace fixtures
   slugs - e.g. those that come installed with AtoM, such as for settings
   pages, browse pages, menus, etc - or any static pages! We strongly recommend
   backing up your database before attempting this - see above,
   :ref:`cli-backup-db` - and we recommend using SQL queries to
   *selectively* delete slugs!
